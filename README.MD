#final-project
Online Shop project with React and Redux. This was my last project, which I chose myself during my training at SPICED ACADEMY.
##Basic Setup
Create a new postgres database, assign that name to the dbName const in server/middlewares/db.js
Create tables. Table creation files are located in server/sql
Create secrets.json file in server/, assign a string value to the property name "COOKIE_SECRET"

```JSON
"COOKIE_SECRET": "MyCookieSecret"
```

##Start
Start with: npm run dev
